#In Part A, we unrealistically assumed that your salary didnâ€™t change.  But you are an MIT graduate, and
#clearly you are going to be worth more to your company over time! So we are going to build on your
#solution to Part A by factoring in a raise every six months. 
#In ps1b.py, copy your solution to Part A (as we are going to reuse much of that machinery).  Modify
#your program to include the following
# 1. Have the user input a semi-annual salary raise semi_annual_raise (as a decimal percentage)
# 2. After the 6th month, increase your salary by that percentage.  Do the same after the 12
#month, the 18  month, and so on. 
#Write a program to calculate how many months it will take you save up enough money for a down
#payment.  LIke before, assume that your investments earn a return of r = 0.04 (or 4%) and the
#required down payment percentage is 0.25 (or 25%).  Have the user enter the following variables:
# 1. The starting annual salary (annual_salary)
# 2. The percentage of salary to be saved (portion_saved)
# 3. The cost of your dream home (total_cost)
# 4. The semi annual salary raise (semi_annual_raise)

total_cost = float(input("Enter a Price for your Dream Home: "))
annual_salary = float(input("Enter your Annual Salary: "))
portion_saved = float(input("Enter portion of Annual Salary saved: "))
semi_annual_raise = float(input("Enter your semi-annual salary rise as a decimal: "))
portion_down_payment = 0.25*total_cost
current_savings = 0
r = 0.04
monthly_salary = annual_salary/12
portion_saved_monthly = portion_saved*monthly_salary
months = 0

while (current_savings < portion_down_payment):
     current_savings += (current_savings*r)/12 + portion_saved_monthly
     months += 1
     if months % 6 == 0:
         annual_salary = (annual_salary*semi_annual_raise + annual_salary)
         monthly_salary = annual_salary/12
         portion_saved_monthly = monthly_salary*portion_saved
